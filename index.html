            <h4>Simon Game</h4>
            <p>
              I have created a drum Simon game using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
              jQuery. The game is based on the popular Simon memory game but
              with drum sounds. It features a visually appealing interface,
              where players need to follow a sequence of drum beats played by
              the computer and replicate it accurately.
